Subject: [PATCH] networkd: rework idle detection logic of networkd

This patch makes networkd stay around as long as there is more than just a
loopback interface around, or the loopback device isn't fully probed yet, or
the loopback device has a .network file attached.

In essence, this means networkd stays around now continously as it should,
unless it is running in some (container?) environment that really has no
interface except a loopback device.

Fixes #2577.

(cherry picked from commit 9dc907f9c93636cb63ca90300fa3b8c03812701f)
